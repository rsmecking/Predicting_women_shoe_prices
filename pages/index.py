            ## Shoe Price Prediction

            ðŸ¦¶My passion for shoes is lackluster at best. I couldn't tell you shoe 
            prices if my life depended on it.


            ðŸ‘¢This has really gone and bit me in the butt a few times. My wife has a 
            healthy appetite for shoes and is quick to destroy any evidence linking 
            cost to the shoes. I have to take her word that it cost a certain amount 
            because it was on sale and clearance.
    

            ðŸ‘ This app is built specifically for individuals who may lack shoe knowledge, 
            and may be curious to roughly how expensive, specifically women shoes are, 
            given certain parameters.
