            ## Shoe Price Prediction

            ðŸ¦¶My passion for shoes is lackluster at best. I couldn't tell
            you shoe price if my life depended on it.

            ðŸ‘¢This has really gone and bit me in the butt a few times.
            My wife has a health appetite and is quick to destroy any
            evidence as to the cost of her multitude of shoes. 
    

            ðŸ‘ This app is built specifically for individuals who may lack shoe 
            knowledge that may be curious to roughly how expensive, specifically 
            women shoes, given certain descriptive words.
